# React Application with Parcel Bundler

## Overview
This project is a React application bundled using Parcel. It includes authentication, Redux state management, protected routes, a sidebar with navigation, tables with Ag Grid, modals for data entry, and rich data visualization using ApexCharts.

## Features

1. **Login Page (Home Page)**
   - The login page is displayed on the home route (`/`).
   - Credentials:
     - Email: `admin@admin.com`
     - Password: `admin@1234`

2. **Redux State Management**
   - Stores logged-in user details.
   - A utility function stores the user email in local storage.
   - On page refresh, the application retrieves user details from local storage and updates the state.

3. **Protected Routes**
   - Dashboard access is restricted to authenticated users.
   - If an unauthenticated user tries to access a protected route, they will be redirected to the login page.

4. **Header**
   - Displays the logged-in userâ€™s email.
   - Includes a logout button.

5. **Sidebar Navigation**
   - Options to switch between `Charts`, `Store`, `SKU`, and `Planning` pages.
   - Active navigation is highlighted.

6. **Store Page**
   - Uses Ag Grid to display tabular data with edit, drag, and delete options.
   - A button to add a new store, opening a modal with input fields.
   - Form validation using Formik.
   - Confirmation modal to confirm data submission.

7. **SKU Page**
   - Similar to the Store page, using Ag Grid for tabular data.
   - Features include editing, dragging, deleting, and adding a new SKU.
   - Uses a modal form with Formik validation.
   - A confirmation modal before inserting data.

8. **Planning Page**
   - Displays sales details segregated by weeks.
   - Identifies which month each week belongs to for data organization.
   - Handles invalid number format errors using a helper function.
   - Uses `GM%` to modify cell styles dynamically.

9. **Charts Page**
   - Uses ApexCharts for rich data visualizations.
   - Features include downloading charts and zooming functionality.

# React Project with Parcel

This is a React project that uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) as the bundler for fast development and optimized production builds.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/adityaxtalk/GS060325_Aditya_Kumar.git
cd GS060325_Aditya_Kumar
npm install
```

### Running the Development Server
To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm start
```
This will start the application in development mode with hot reloading.

### Building for Production
To create an optimized production build, run:

```sh
npm run build
```
This will generate a `dist/` folder containing the production-ready files.


## Scripts
- `npm start` - Runs the development server.
- `npm run build` - Builds the project for production.
- `npm run clean` - Removes the `dist` and `.parcel-cache` directories.



## Notes
- Ensure **Node.js** and **npm** are installed.
- Parcel automatically detects and optimizes assets.
- State is persisted using **local storage**.
- Login authentication is implemented via Redux state.
- Protected routes redirect unauthorized users to the login page.
