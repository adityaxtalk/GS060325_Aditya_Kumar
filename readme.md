# React Project with Parcel

This is a React project that uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) as the bundler for fast development and optimized production builds.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/adityaxtalk/GS060325_Aditya_Kumar.git
cd GS060325_Aditya_Kumar
npm install
```

### Running the Development Server
To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm start
```
This will start the application in development mode with hot reloading.

### Building for Production
To create an optimized production build, run:

```sh
npm run build
```
This will generate a `dist/` folder containing the production-ready files.


## Scripts
- `npm start` - Runs the development server.
- `npm run build` - Builds the project for production.
- `npm run clean` - Removes the `dist` and `.parcel-cache` directories.
